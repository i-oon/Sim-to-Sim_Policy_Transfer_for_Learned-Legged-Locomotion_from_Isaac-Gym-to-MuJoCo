# Sim-to-Sim Policy Transfer for Learned Legged Locomotion
**Isaac Gym → MuJoCo | Command Switching / Transient Response Study**

---
Sim-to-real transfer for legged locomotion policies faces significant challenges due to differences in simulation environments and real-world hardware, including discrepancies in actuator dynamics, contact modeling, and real-time constraints.

Sim-to-sim transfer serves as a crucial intermediate step, enabling us to evaluate a learned policy’s ability to adapt to different simulation environments before real-world deployment. This helps identify issues such as mismatches in actuator stiffness, friction models, and solver behavior, which could lead to instability during transient behaviors like command switching.

This repository accompanies **Exam 2** of the Sim2Real Internship Candidate Exam from VISTEC. The objective is to analyze **sim-to-sim policy transfer mismatch** for learned legged locomotion policies under **contact-rich dynamics**, with focus on **transient responses induced by command switching**. A locomotion policy is trained in **Isaac Gym (Sim A)** and transferred **without retraining** to **MuJoCo (Sim B)**.

## Overview

This repository accompanies **Exam 2** of the Sim2Real Internship Candidate Exam from VISTEC.  

The objective is to analyze **sim-to-sim policy transfer mismatch** for learned legged locomotion policies under **contact-rich dynamics**, with focus on **transient responses induced by command switching**.

A locomotion policy is trained in **Isaac Gym (Sim A)** and transferred **without retraining** to **MuJoCo (Sim B)**.

    </br> Similarity in IsaacLab and Isaac Gym
</p>

While we have verified that Isaac Lab can produce deployable policies to Mujoco with equivalent performance of Isaac Gym, we selected **Isaac Gym as our primary framework** due to its simpler sim-to-sim pipeline of requiring no joint order remapping and its well-adoption in legged locomotion research.

## Research Questions

1. **Why do locomotion policies that exhibit similar steady-state performance diverge significantly during transient command switches?**

2. **Which sim-to-sim mismatches (actuator stiffness, solver dynamics, contact models) are amplified during high-acceleration maneuvers?**

3. **Can transient response metrics serve as a more sensitive indicator of sim-to-real transferability than steady-state tracking error?**

---

## Robot Platform

<p align="center">
    <img width=60% src="sources\Robots_Unitree_Go2.png">
    </br> The Unitree Go2 is a quadrupedal mobile robot designed for a variety of applications including research, field operations, education, and industrial tasks.
</p>

- **source:** [unitree_rl_gym](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_rl_gym)
- **Robot:** Unitree Go2 Quadruped
- **DOF:** 12 (3 joints × 4 legs)
- **Joint Order Isaac Gym:** FL, FR, RL, RR (hip, thigh, calf per leg)
- **Joint Order MuJoCo qpos:** FL, FR, RL, RR (same as Isaac Gym)
- **Actuator Order MuJoCo ctrl:** FR, FL, RR, RL (requires remapping)


The Go2 uses **quasi-direct drive (QDD) actuators** with low gear ratio (~6-10:1), placing its dynamics complexity between platforms studied in prior sim-to-real work:

| Paper | Robot | Actuator Type | Modeling Approach |
|-------|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| Tan et al. (2018) | Minitaur | Direct-drive (no gears) | Analytical model (T = Kt·I) |
| Hwangbo et al. (2019) | ANYmal | Series-Elastic (SEA) | Learned ActuatorNet |
| Peng et al. (2018) | Laikago | Proprioceptive / QDD | Domain randomization |
| Kumar et al. (2021) | Unitree A1 | QDD  | RMA adaptation |

The Go2 (and its predecessor A1) sits in the **middle ground**: simple enough that basic PD control works for steady-state, but with sufficient non-linearities (gear friction, torque saturation) that might become problematic during transient maneuvers. 

This makes it an ideal testbed for comparing all three paradigms, analytical models (Tan), learned actuator models (Hwangbo), and adaptive policies (Kumar).

## Observation Space (48 dimensions)

```
obs[0:3]   = base_lin_vel * 2.0        # Linear velocity (body frame)
obs[3:6]   = base_ang_vel * 0.25       # Angular velocity (body frame)
obs[6:9]   = projected_gravity         # Gravity in body frame
obs[9:12]  = cmd * cmd_scale           # Command [vx, vy, wz]
obs[12:24] = (joint_pos - default) * 1.0  # Joint positions
obs[24:36] = joint_vel * 0.05          # Joint velocities

**Overall Findings:**

1. **DR-trained excels at stability metrics** — consistently lowest torque, pitch, and roll
2. **Residual excels at response speed** — fastest rise time in S2 Turn
3. **ActuatorNet V3 fixes V2's critical weakness** — now stable in S2 Turn scenario
4. **Trade-off exists:**
   - DR-trained: Best stability, higher complexity

## Experimental Results

### Stage 0: Baseline Parity (Sanity Checks)

**Goal:** Ensure policy interface is correctly implemented before measuring physics mismatch.

| Check | Status | Result |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Zero-Action Stability | ✓ Pass | Height stable ~0.27m, roll/pitch < 3° |
| Observation Parity | ✓ Pass | Gravity diff < 0.03, lin_vel diff < 0.05 |
| Joint Order Verification | ✓ Pass | qpos order matches, ctrl order remapped |

**Key Implementation Fixes:**

1. **Quaternion Convention:**
   - Isaac Gym: (x, y, z, w)
   - MuJoCo: (w, x, y, z)

2. **Actuator Remapping:**
```python
# Isaac Gym: FL(0-2), FR(3-5), RL(6-8), RR(9-11)
# MuJoCo:    FR(0-2), FL(3-5), RR(6-8), RL(9-11)
d.ctrl[0:3] = tau[3:6]   # FR
d.ctrl[3:6] = tau[0:3]   # FL
d.ctrl[6:9] = tau[9:12]  # RR
d.ctrl[9:12] = tau[6:9]  # RL
```

3. **Velocity Frame Transformation:**
```python
# MuJoCo gives world frame → transform to body frame
base_lin_vel = quat_rotate_inverse(quat, world_lin_vel)
base_ang_vel = quat_rotate_inverse(quat, world_ang_vel)
```

### Stage 1: Baseline Performance (Steady-State + Transient)

> Before attributing sim-to-sim mismatch to any specific source, we first establish a baseline comparison under nominal and well-controlled conditions. This step answers a fundamental question: *does a gap exist at all when both simulators are configured as similarly as possible?*

**Goal:** Measure sim-to-sim gap under nominal conditions (flat ground, default friction, no noise/delay) both using PD Controllers.

#### Stage 1 Key Observation: Divergent Yaw Behavior

A significant behavioral difference was observed in S2 Turn:

| Period | Isaac Gym wz | MuJoCo wz | Note |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------|
| t=0-1s (init) | **-0.807 rad/s** | +0.018 rad/s | Isaac rotates without command! |
| t=1-3s (pre-switch) | -0.422 rad/s | -0.004 rad/s | Isaac still rotating |
| t=3-4s (post-switch) | -0.196 rad/s | **+0.710 rad/s** | Opposite directions |
| Total yaw change | **-117.3°** (CCW) | **+118.0°** (CW) | Same magnitude, opposite sign |

**Raw Data Ranges:**
- Isaac Gym wz: [-1.098, -0.032] rad/s — **always negative**
- MuJoCo wz: [-0.112, +0.839] rad/s — **mostly positive after switch**

> ⚠️ **Note on Plots:** In comparison plots, Isaac Gym wz sign is flipped (`-wz`) to visually align the turning behavior. The raw data shows opposite signs.

#### Root Cause Analysis: Heading Command Mode

We investigated why Isaac Gym shows rotation when command wz=0:

**Initial Observation:**
| Test | Command wz | Actual wz | Result |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Zero action (no policy) | 0 | **0.000** | ✓ Environment OK |
| Policy + set wz=0 directly | 0 | **-0.554** | X Unexpected rotation |

**Root Cause Discovery:**

The config uses `heading_command = True`:
```python
# In legged_robot.py post_physics_step:
if self.cfg.commands.heading_command:
    self.commands[:, 2] = torch.clip(0.5*wrap_to_pi(self.commands[:, 3] - heading), -1., 1.)
```

**This means:**
- `commands[:, 2]` (wz) is **NOT a direct command** — it's **computed from heading error**
- `commands[:, 3]` is the **target heading** (in radians)
- Policy was trained to track **heading**, not angular velocity
- When we set `commands[:, 2] = 0` directly, it gets **overwritten** by the heading controller

**Verification:**

| Test | Method | wz (cmd=0) | Result |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| X Wrong | Set `commands[:, 2] = 0` | -0.55 rad/s | wz overwritten |
| ✓ Correct | Set `commands[:, 3] = current_heading` | **-0.009 rad/s** | No rotation |

**Fixed Results (using heading command correctly):**

| Scenario | wz Before Switch | wz After Switch | Status |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|--------|
| S1 Stop | -0.003 rad/s | -0.036 rad/s | ✓ |
| S2 Turn | -0.009 rad/s | -0.778 rad/s | ✓ |
| S3 Lateral | -0.008 rad/s | +0.005 rad/s | ✓ |




**Key Lesson:**
- Always check `env_cfg.commands.heading_command` before setting commands
- If `heading_command = True`: set `commands[:, 3]` (target heading)
- If `heading_command = False`: set `commands[:, 2]` (angular velocity)
- This is **not a bug** — it's a different control mode that requires different command interface


**Interpretation:** Both robots rotate approximately the same magnitude (~118°) but in **opposite directions**. This indicates:
1. A **sign convention difference** between PhysX and MuJoCo for yaw rate
2. Isaac Gym exhibits large **initial transient** that decays, while MuJoCo remains stable until command switch
3. The policy behaves fundamentally differently in the two simulators despite identical network weights


> At this stage, it remains unclear which physical factors are responsible for the observed transient divergence.

---

### Stage 1.5: Parameter Ablation (One-Factor-at-a-Time)

> To identify the source of the transient mismatch observed in Stage 1, we next vary individual simulator parameters in MuJoCo while holding all others fixed. This one-factor-at-a-time ablation aims to isolate which mismatches materially affect performance.

**Goal:** Identify causal sources of mismatch by varying parameters individually in MuJoCo.

#### 1. Kp (Stiffness) Sweep

| Kp | vx mean | vx error | Notes |
|----|---------|----------|-------|
| 10 | 0.101 m/s | 0.399 | Nearly crawling |
| **20 (baseline)** | **0.451 m/s** | **0.049** | Default |
| **30** | **0.466 m/s** | **0.034** | **Best match to Isaac Gym** |
| 40 | 0.407 m/s | 0.093 | Worse (overshoot) |


**Finding:** Kp=30 in MuJoCo best matches Isaac Gym (Kp=20) performance. MuJoCo requires ~50% higher stiffness to achieve equivalent actuator response.

<p align="center">
   <img src="plots\kp_ablation.png" width="400" alt="kp_ablation">
   </br> Kp=30 in Mujoco best matches Isaac Gym 
</p>


#### 2. Kd (Damping) Sweep

| Kd | vx mean | wz overshoot | Max pitch | Max roll | Peak torque |
|----|---------|-------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| 0.3 | 0.348 m/s | -0.167 | 4.5° | 6.3° | 14.82 N·m |
| **0.5 (baseline)** | **0.353 m/s** | **-0.161** | **5.0°** | **5.1°** | **15.32 N·m** |
| 0.8 | 0.349 m/s | -0.079 | 5.0° | 6.9° | 15.25 N·m |
| 1.0 | 0.344 m/s | -0.090 | 4.7° | 5.1° | 15.22 N·m |


<p align="center">
   <img src="plots\kd_ablation.png" width="600" alt="kd_ablation">
   </br> Kp=30 in Mujoco best matches Isaac Gym 
</p>


**Finding:** Kd has minimal effect on both tracking and transient stability. Unlike Kp — where a 10→40 sweep produced dramatic changes from near-crawling to overshoot — varying Kd by 3× (0.3→1.0) produces less than 0.1 rad/s difference in wz overshoot and no fall in any condition. Higher Kd slightly reduces overshoot (Kd=0.8 achieves -0.079 vs -0.167 at Kd=0.3) but does not meaningfully change peak torque or body excursion. This confirms that **actuator stiffness (Kp), not damping (Kd), is the dominant PD gain mismatch** in this sim-to-sim transfer.

#### 3. Mass (Base Link) Perturbation

| Base mass | Δmass | vx (steady) | wz overshoot | Max pitch | Peak torque |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| 5.921 kg | -1 kg | 0.363 m/s | -0.220 | 3.8° | 13.63 N·m |
| **6.921 kg (baseline)** | **0** | **0.353 m/s** | **-0.161** | **5.0°** | **15.32 N·m** |
| 7.921 kg | +1 kg | 0.358 m/s | +0.374 | **15.5°**  | **23.11 N·m**  |
| 8.921 kg | +2 kg | 0.237 m/s | -0.049 | 11.2°  | 21.56 N·m  |

<p align="center">
   <img src="plots\mass_ablation.png" width="600" alt="mass_ablation">
   </br> Adding +1 kg nearly triples peak pitch
</p>

**Finding:** Mass perturbation has a significant and **asymmetric** effect on transient stability. Adding just +1 kg (14% increase) nearly triples peak pitch (15.5° vs 5.0°) and increases peak torque by 51%, while removing -1 kg has minimal impact. At +2 kg, the robot can barely maintain forward velocity (0.237 vs 0.353 m/s) as the policy's learned torque patterns become insufficient for the increased inertia.

This asymmetry is consistent with the policy being trained at a fixed mass — additional mass demands torques beyond what the policy learned to produce, while reduced mass stays within the policy's safe operating envelope. This finding further validates the Domain Randomization approach (Approach 3), which randomizes mass during training by [-1 kg, +2 kg] to explicitly handle such variation.


#### 4. Joint Friction (Viscous + Coulomb) Sweep

MuJoCo's go2.xml includes joint-level friction parameters (`damping` for viscous friction, `frictionloss` for Coulomb friction) that have no direct equivalent in Isaac Gym's PhysX engine. We sweep these to quantify their contribution:

| Condition | damping | frictionloss | vx (steady) | wz overshoot | Max roll | Max pitch | Peak torque |
|-----------|---------|-------------|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| No friction | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.361 m/s | -0.147 | **9.3°** | 5.0° | 14.79 N·m |
| **Baseline** | **0.1** | **0.2** | **0.353 m/s** | **-0.161** | **5.1°** | **5.0°** | **15.32 N·m** |
| High friction | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.326 m/s | -0.054 | **3.4°** | 4.7° | 15.02 N·m |

<p align="center">
   <img src="plots\joint_friction_ablation.png" width="600" alt="mass_ablation">
   </br> Joint friction behaved like a passive damper
</p>

**Finding:** Joint friction has a moderate effect, primarily on **roll stability** rather than tracking or torque. Removing all joint friction increases peak roll by 82% (9.3° vs 5.1°), while high friction reduces it by 33% (3.4°) at the cost of slower velocity tracking. Unlike Kp which affects overall actuator response, joint friction acts as a passive damper that suppresses oscillation during transient maneuvers. This represents a **structural mismatch** between simulators — MuJoCo models joint friction explicitly, while Isaac Gym's PhysX does not expose equivalent parameters, potentially absorbing similar effects into its contact solver.


#### 5. dt (Timestep) Sweep

| dt | decimation | Policy rate | vx mean | vx error |
|----|------------|-------------|---------|----------|
| 0.002 | 10 | 50 Hz | 0.410 | 0.090 |
| 0.005 | 4 | 50 Hz | 0.451 | 0.049 |
| 0.01 | 2 | 50 Hz | 0.408 | 0.092 |

**Finding:** Timestep has minimal effect when policy rate is kept constant at 50 Hz.

#### 6. Floor Friction Sweep

| Floor friction | vx mean | vx error |
|----------------|---------|----------|
| 0.5 | 0.451 | 0.049 |
| 1.0 | 0.451 | 0.049 |
| 1.5 | 0.451 | 0.049 |

**Finding:** Floor friction has no measurable effect across the entire tested range.

> The floor friction sweep initially produced a surprising result: varying μ_floor between 0.5 and 1.5 resulted in no observable change. This raised a critical follow-up question: Is friction truly irrelevant, or are we varying the wrong parameter?


---

### Stage 2: Foot Friction Sweep

To further investigate why the behavior of the floor friction sweep produced no observable change, this motivated us testing **foot friction** directly. And we found that MuJoCo uses geometric mean of contacting surfaces:

$$\mu_{effective} \approx \sqrt{\mu_{floor} \times \mu_{foot}}$$

Because the default foot friction in MuJoCo is low (μ_foot=0.4), the effective friction remains low (≈0.63) even if the floor friction is increased significantly.

Since incresing **the floor friction** is physically unrealistic, as [Tan et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10332) had said that real-world surfaces used in robotics research range from approximately **0.5 (polished tile) to 1.25 (rubber mat)**. Pushing μ_floor beyond this range to compensate for low foot friction would produce a policy tuned to an environment that doesn't exist in the real world, defeating the purpose of sim-to-sim validation.

To match the dynamics of Isaac Gym (where μ≈1.0), we hypothesized that the foot friction must be the primary variable for tuning (System ID).

**Method:** Vary foot friction μ_foot ∈ {0.2, 0.4, 0.8} while holding floor friction constant at 1.0.

#### S2: Turn Shock (wz: 0.0 → 1.0)

| Metric | μ_foot=0.2 | μ_foot=0.4 (baseline) | μ_foot=0.8 |
|--------|------------|----------------------|------------|
| Steady-State vx | 0.294 m/s | 0.353 m/s | 0.353 m/s |
| wz overshoot | **+1.868 rad/s** | -0.161 rad/s | -0.254 rad/s |
| Max roll | **17.8°** | 5.1° | **5.3°** |
| Max pitch | **25.1°** | 5.0° | **3.0°** |
| Peak torque | **27.57 N·m** | 15.32 N·m | **13.65 N·m** |

   <br> Foot Friction of 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 while holding floor friction constant at 1.0.
</p>  

#### Stage 2 Findings

1. **Foot friction has significant impact** while floor friction had little influenced — confirming that foot friction is the bottleneck.

2. **High friction (μ=0.8) improves stability:**
   - Max roll: 5.3° (vs 17.8° at μ=0.2) — **70% reduction**
   - Max pitch: 3.0° (vs 25.1° at μ=0.2) — **88% reduction**
   - Peak torque: 13.65 N·m (vs 27.57 N·m) — **50% reduction**

3. **Low friction (μ=0.2) causes severe instability:**
   - wz overshoot +1.868 rad/s (nearly 2x target!)
   - Peak torque nearly doubles
   - Robot approaches fall conditions

> **Interpretation:** When foot friction is low, the system enters a **slip-prone regime** where lateral forces cannot be fully transmitted to the ground. The policy compensates by increasing torque output, but this leads to larger body excursions and potential instability.
>
> This confirms that **friction mismatch between Isaac Gym (μ=1.0) and MuJoCo (μ_foot=0.4) contributes to the observed sim-to-sim gap**.

---

### Stage 3: Observation Delay

> Thus far, all experiments assume perfect and instantaneous state feedback. While this isolates physics-related mismatch, real robots operate under sensing latency. We therefore consider whether transient sensitivity is further amplified by observation delays.

**Goal:** Evaluate sensitivity to sensing latency during transient command switches.

**Method:** Introduce observation delay of 0, 1, 2 policy steps (0, 20, 40 ms) in MuJoCo.

**Scenario:** S2 Turn (most challenging based on Stage 1 results)

   <br> Observation Delay of 0, 1, 2 policy steps
</p>

#### Stage 3 Key Finding: 20ms Delay Causes Fall

**Just 20ms of observation delay (1 policy step) causes the robot to fall**

This is a critical finding for sim-to-real transfer:
- Real robots typically have 10-50ms sensing latency
- Transient maneuvers are highly sensitive to delay
- Steady-state metrics do not predict this failure mode

> **Interpretation:** Observation delay causes the policy to act on outdated state information. During rapid transient maneuvers like turning, even small delays lead to:
> - **Over-correction:** Policy continues commanding turn after robot has already turned
> - **Oscillation:** Delayed feedback creates unstable control loop
> - **Fall:** At 20ms delay, oscillations exceed recovery limits
>
> Interestingly, 40ms delay does not cause fall — this suggests **chaotic sensitivity** where specific delay values interact with gait timing in unpredictable ways.

---

---

### Stage 3.5: Motor Command Delay

> Stage 3 demonstrated that observation delay (input-side latency) is critically destabilizing. However, real robots also experience actuator command delay — the time between computing a torque command and the motor physically executing it. We now test this output-side counterpart to complete the latency analysis.

**Goal:** Evaluate sensitivity to motor command latency during transient command switches and compare with observation delay from Stage 3.

**Method:** Buffer the target joint positions by 0, 1, 2 policy steps (0, 20, 40 ms) before applying PD control. Unlike observation delay where the policy receives stale state, here the policy observes correct state but the actuators execute outdated commands.

**Scenario:** S2 Turn (consistent with Stage 3)

#### Results

   <img width=45% src="sources\mujoco_s2.gif">
   <img width=45% src="sources\motor_delay_40s.gif">
   <br> Motor Input with no Letency vs. Motor Input with 40ms Letency

| Motor delay | wz overshoot | Max pitch | Max roll | Peak torque | Fallen |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| 0 ms | -0.161 | 5.0° | 5.1° | 15.32 N·m | No |
| 20 ms (1 step) | +0.241 | 6.1° | 5.3° | 19.44 N·m | No |
| 40 ms (2 steps) | +0.246 | 18.9° | 73.5° | exploded | **YES**  |

#### Stage 3.5 Key Finding: Motor Delay is Less Critical than Observation Delay



Comparing both delay types at the same latency values reveals a clear asymmetry:

| Delay | Observation (input, Stage 3) | Motor command (output, Stage 3.5) |
|-------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| 0 ms | Stable | Stable |
| 20 ms | **FELL** | Stable |
| 40 ms | Stable | **FELL**  |

*Observation delay at 40ms shows chaotic sensitivity — see Stage 3.

**20ms motor delay is survivable**  while 20ms observation delay caused immediate fall. This asymmetry makes physical sense:

- **Observation delay** → policy makes decisions based on **stale state** → compounding errors (thinks robot hasn't turned yet, keeps commanding turn)
- **Motor delay** → policy sees **correct state** and makes appropriate decisions → only execution is late → self-correcting to some degree

<p align="center">
   <img src="plots\motor_delay_ablation.png" width="600" alt="motor_delay_ablation">
   <br> Observation Delay vs. Motor Delay
</p>

At 40ms motor delay, the execution lag becomes too large and the robot falls — confirming that both delay sources matter, but with different severity thresholds.

> **Implication for sim-to-real:** Observation latency is more dangerous than actuator latency. When designing real-time control pipelines, prioritize **low-latency state estimation** (IMU, joint encoders) over actuator response time. For the Go2's QDD actuators with typical command latency of ~5-10ms, motor delay alone is unlikely to cause instability — but combined with sensing latency, the total loop delay could exceed critical thresholds. This aligns with **Tan's paper** findings on the Minitaur, where identifying and modeling latency (approx. 15-19ms in their case) was crucial for preventing oscillations during sim-to-real transfer.


## Summary of Mismatch Sources

### Physics Mismatch (Ablated)

| Source | Effect on Tracking | Effect on Stability | Recommendation |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Kp (stiffness)** | High | Medium | Use Kp=30 in MuJoCo to match Isaac Gym Kp=20 |
| **Kd (damping)** | Low | Low | Not a significant factor (Kp dominates) |
| **Mass perturbation** | Medium | **High** | +1kg nearly triples pitch; asymmetric response |
| **Joint friction** | Low | Medium | Affects roll stability; structural mismatch between sims |
| **Foot friction** | Medium | **High** | Match μ_foot to real robot (~0.6-0.8 for rubber) |
| **Floor friction** | None | None | Not a significant factor (bottleneck is foot) |
| **Timestep** | Low | Low | Keep policy rate constant |
| **Observation delay** | Medium | **Critical** | 20ms causes fall in S2 Turn |
| **Motor command delay** | Low | **High** | Less critical than obs delay; 20ms survivable, 40ms causes fall |
| **Torque clipping** | Medium | High | Isaac Gym clips at ±30 N·m (implicit) |
| **Velocity-dependent dynamics** | Medium | High | Isaac Gym has implicit vel-dependent compensation; residual learning captures this |

### Implementation Pitfalls

| Source | Description | Fix |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| **Quaternion convention** | Isaac Gym (x,y,z,w) vs MuJoCo (w,x,y,z) | Reorder before computing gravity/velocity |
| **Yaw sign convention** | Opposite rotation direction between sims | Document and flip sign in comparison plots |
| **Actuator ordering** | MuJoCo ctrl uses FR,FL,RR,RL | Remap: `ctrl[0:3]=tau[3:6]`, etc. |
| **Heading command mode** | `heading_command=True` overwrites `commands[:,2]` | Set `commands[:,3]` (target heading), not `[:,2]` (wz) |

### Known but Not Ablated

The following mismatch sources are identified in prior sim-to-real literature but were not individually ablated in this study. They remain relevant for future investigation:

| Source | Referenced In | Description | Expected Impact |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Contact solver differences** | Implicit in all papers | PhysX (Isaac Gym) uses iterative Gauss-Seidel while MuJoCo uses Newton-based convex optimization — fundamentally different contact resolution | High — likely a root cause of the Kp stiffness gap, but cannot be isolated without modifying solver internals |
| **Ground compliance** | Peng et al. (2020) | Rigid vs. soft contact modeling differences between engines | Low — both simulators use rigid flat ground in this study |

> **Note:** The contact solver difference is likely the most impactful untested source, as it affects how forces propagate through the kinematic chain during contact. The observed Kp mismatch (Stage 1.5) and foot friction sensitivity (Stage 2) are both downstream effects of different solver behaviors. However, this cannot be ablated as a single parameter — it is an architectural difference between simulation engines.

## Conclusions

### Key Findings

1.  **Steady-state metrics mask critical instability exposed by transient maneuvers.**
    
    While the baseline velocity tracking error differed by only **~9%** during steady walking, the **S2 Turn** scenario revealed divergences in stability. This confirms that sim-to-sim validation must prioritize transient response analysis (overshoot, rise time) over steady-state averages.

2.  **Simulators enforce conflicting coordinate conventions.**
    
    Isaac Gym and MuJoCo exhibit **opposite yaw rotation directions** for the same positive $w_z$ command. Despite the sign mismatch, the magnitude of rotation ($\approx 118^\circ$) was consistent, indicating a coordinate system difference rather than a policy failure.

3.  **Solver stiffness discrepancy necessitates gain tuning ($K_p$).**
    
    Matching actuator performance required increasing $K_p$ in MuJoCo ($30$ vs. $20$ in Isaac Gym). This suggests that Isaac Gym’s PhysX engine (iterative solver) behaves "softer" than MuJoCo’s Newton-based solver, requiring higher gains in MuJoCo to achieve equivalent stiffness.

4.  **Contact stability is bottlenecked by foot friction, not floor friction.**
    
    Varying floor friction had no effect due to MuJoCo’s geometric mean calculation ($\sqrt{\mu_{floor}\mu_{foot}}$). Increasing $\mu_{foot}$ to **0.8** (rubber) resolved the bottleneck, reducing peak torque by **50%** and pitch oscillation by **88%**.

5.  **Observation latency is the critical failure mode.**
    
    A mere **20ms observation delay** caused immediate falls during turning maneuvers, whereas motor command delays of the same magnitude were survivable. This highlights that "input-side" latency (state estimation) is significantly more destabilizing than "output-side" latency.





### Answers to Research Questions

**Q1: Why do policies diverge during transients?**
> Policies diverge because transient states (high acceleration) expose implicit simulator behaviors that remain dormant during steady-state. Specifically, differences in contact solver stiffness (PhysX vs. Newton) and observation timing amplify errors when the policy commands rapid corrections. Crucially, Isaac Gym's implicit torque clipping (±30 N·m) acts as a "silent safety net" that is absent in MuJoCo, causing the same policy to produce destabilizing torque spikes in the new environment.

**Q2: Which mismatches are amplified during high-acceleration maneuvers?**
> Observation delay and Foot friction are the most amplified mismatches. A 20ms delay, which is negligible during walking, becomes catastrophic during rapid turns due to phase lag in the feedback loop. Similarly, low foot friction creates a "slip-prone regime" only when lateral forces peak. While actuator stiffness (Kp) affects dynamics globally, torque saturation limits become the deciding factor between stability and failure during high-demand command switches (S2).

**Q3: Can transient metrics serve as better transferability indicators?**
> **Yes**. Steady-state metrics proved deceptive, showing only a ~9% gap even when the policy was critically unstable. Transient metrics (specifically Overshoot, Rise Time, and Peak Torque) successfully revealed the system's fragility to latency and friction. Therefore, "Survival during Transients" is a far superior predictor of Sim-to-Real robustness than "Average Tracking Error."

### Recommendations for Sim-to-Real Transfer

1. **Tune Kp/Kd gains** — MuJoCo requires ~50% higher Kp than Isaac Gym
2. **Match foot friction** to real robot contact properties (rubber ≈ 0.6-0.8)
3. **Add observation delay** (20-40ms) during training/validation
4. **Test turning maneuvers** — they expose the largest gaps
5. **Verify sign conventions** for angular velocities and quaternions
6. **Use transient metrics** (peak torque, max pitch) in addition to tracking error
7. **Add torque clipping** in MuJoCo to match Isaac Gym behavior (±30 N·m)

## Bonus: Mismatch Reduction via Learned Actuator Models

This section explores using neural network-based actuator models to reduce sim-to-sim mismatch.

### Approach 1: ActuatorNet (Direct Torque Prediction)

**Concept:** Replace PD control entirely with a learned model that predicts torque from Isaac Gym data.

**Reference:** [actuator_net](https://github.com/sunzhon/actuator_net) — originally designed for sim-to-real transfer.

#### ActuatorNet V1: Normal Walking Data (Failed)

**Method:**

**Results V1:**

| Metric | ActuatorNet V1 | PD Control |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| vx error | 0.277 m/s | **0.049 m/s** |
| Torque max | 26.2 N·m | **15.7 N·m** |

**Problem Analysis:**
- High R² (99.21%) but poor deployment performance

#### ActuatorNet V2: Policy-Driven Excitation Data

Following the need for diverse data, we collected **policy-driven excitation trajectories**:

**Excitation Data Collection:**
```
Phase 1: Normal walking (varied commands)     - 300,000 samples
Phase 2: Random joint perturbations           - 150,000 samples  
Phase 3: High-speed commands                  - 150,000 samples
Phase 4: Sudden command switches              - 150,000 samples
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total: 750,000 samples (25x more than V1)
```

**Data Coverage Improvement:**

| Metric | V1 (Normal) | V2 (Excitation) | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Samples | 30,000 | **750,000** | **25x** |
| Velocity range | ±20 rad/s | **±37 rad/s** | 1.85x |
| Torque range | ±26 N·m | **±35.5 N·m** | Reaches limits |

**Training Results:**
- Architecture: MLP [100 units, 4 layers] with softsign activation
- Features: `[pos_error, velocity, pos_error × velocity]`
- R² = 94.55% (lower than V1, but on diverse data = better generalization)

**Results V2 - S2 Command Switch (wz: 0→1.0 at t=3s):**

| Metric | PD Control | ActuatorNet V2 | Change |
|--------|------------|----------------|--------|
| Status | Stable | **Unstable** | — |
| Torque max | **15.32 N·m** | 28.49 N·m | +86% X |
| Max pitch | **5.0°** | 17.8° | +256% X |
| Max roll | **5.1°** | 15.3° | +200% X |

**V2 Limitation:** While V2 improved over V1, it still struggled with **transient turn commands (S2)** due to policy-driven data not covering the full actuator dynamics space.

#### ActuatorNet V3: Hwangbo-Style Excitation (Fixed S2 Instability)

**Reference:** Hwangbo et al., "[Learning agile and dynamic motor skills for legged robots](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.aau5872)" (Science Robotics 2019) 

The key insight from Hwangbo's paper is that **actuator data should be collected independently from locomotion policy**, using systematic excitation signals that cover the full operating range.

**Key Differences from V2:**

| Aspect | V2 (Policy-Driven) | V3 (Hwangbo-Style) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Data source | Policy locomotion | **Systematic excitation** |
| Sinusoidal sweep | X None | ✓ 0.5-10 Hz |
| Chirp (freq sweep) | X None | ✓ 0.5→10 Hz |
| Torque saturation probing | Partial | ✓ Deliberate |
| Decoupled from task | X No | ✓ Yes |
| Identifiability | Low | **High** |

**Hwangbo Excitation Data Collection:**
```
Phase 1: Low-frequency sinusoids (0.5-2 Hz)   - 60,000 samples
Phase 2: Mid-frequency sinusoids (2-5 Hz)    - 60,000 samples
Phase 3: High-frequency sinusoids (5-10 Hz)  - 60,000 samples
Phase 4: Chirp sweep (0.5→10 Hz)             - 120,000 samples
Phase 5: Torque saturation probing           - 60,000 samples
Phase 6: Multi-sine (mixed frequencies)      - 60,000 samples
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total: 420,000 samples with full frequency coverage
```

**Simulated Actuator Dynamics:**

To make the learning problem non-trivial (avoid R²=1.0 data leakage), we added realistic actuator dynamics:

```python
class ActuatorDynamics:
    motor_time_constant = 0.02s    # First-order lag
    viscous_friction = 0.1 N·m/(rad/s)
    coulomb_friction = 0.5 N·m
    noise_std = 0.1 N·m
```

**Training Results:**
- Architecture: MLP [100 units, 4 layers] with softsign activation
- Features: `[pos_error, pos_error_t-1, pos_error_t-2, vel, vel_t-1, vel_t-2]` (6 features with history)
- R² = 99.80% on test set
- Training stopped early at epoch 44

**Results V3 - S1 Stop (vx: 0.6 → 0.0):**

| Metric | V2 | V3 | Change |

| Peak pitch | 5.1° | **4.5°** | -12% X |
| Peak roll | **2.9°** | 6.3° | +117% |

**V3 Key Achievement:** Successfully fixed the S2 Turn instability that plagued V2, with **84% reduction in peak pitch** and **53% reduction in peak torque**.

#### ActuatorNet Conclusions

<p align="center">
    <img width=80% src="plots/actuatornet_s2_v2_v3_fix.png">
    <br> ActuatorNet Performance of V2 and V3 Compares to PD Controller 
</p>


| Version | Data Type | Normal Walking | Constant Turn | Command Switch (S2) |
|---------|-----------|----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **V1** | Normal walking | X Worse | — | — |
| **V2** | Policy excitation | ✓ Comparable | ✓ Stable |  **Unstable** |
| **V3** | Hwangbo excitation | ✓ Comparable | ✓ Stable | ✓ **Stable** |

**Key Insights:**

1. **Data diversity matters more than R²** — V1 had 99.21% R² but failed; V2 had 94.55% but works better
2. **Systematic excitation > policy-driven excitation** — V3's Hwangbo-style data collection fixed V2's S2 instability
3. **Frequency coverage is critical** — sinusoidal sweeps and chirp signals ensure full actuator dynamics coverage
4. **History features help** — V3 uses `[pos_error_t-2:t, vel_t-2:t]` for temporal modeling

**Recommendation:** For ActuatorNet to work reliably:
- Use **Hwangbo-style systematic excitation** (not policy-driven)
- Include **sinusoidal sweeps** across 0.5-10 Hz frequency range
- Add **chirp signals** for continuous frequency coverage
- Include **torque saturation probing** to reach actuator limits
- For best overall robustness, prefer **DR-trained** over ActuatorNet

---

### Approach 2: Residual Learning (PD + Learned Correction)

**Concept:** Instead of replacing PD control, learn a residual correction term:

```
τ_mujoco = τ_pd + Δτ_learned
```

Where `Δτ_learned` compensates for the difference between Isaac Gym and MuJoCo actuator responses.

**Method:**
1. Collected residual data: `Δτ = τ_isaac - τ_pd` from Isaac Gym
2. Residual statistics: mean=0.011 N·m, std=0.810 N·m, range=[-19.7, +18.0] N·m
3. Trained ResidualNet: input `[pos_error, velocity]` → output `Δτ`
4. Test RMSE: 0.577 N·m
5. Deployed: `τ_mujoco = τ_pd + Δτ_learned`

**Results - Steady-State Baseline (vx=0.5 m/s):**

| Metric | PD Only | PD + Residual | Improvement |
|--------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| vx error | 0.049 m/s | 0.043 m/s | **-12%** ✓ |
| Torque max | 15.71 N·m | 15.42 N·m | -2% |

#### For futhermore and esier behavior comparison, we tested more on Continuous Turn Command of  (0.4, 0.0, 1.0)

**Results - Turn Command (wz=1.0 rad/s, constant):**

<p align="center">

| vx error | 0.093 m/s | 0.052 m/s | **-44%** ✓ |
| wz error | 0.395 rad/s | 0.338 rad/s | **-14%** ✓ |
| Status | **FALLEN** | Stable | **Fixed!** ✓ |

**Results - S2 Command Switch (wz: 0→1.0 at t=3s):**

| Metric | PD Only | PD + Residual | Improvement |
|--------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Torque max | 15.32 N·m | 14.64 N·m | **-4.4%** ✓ |
| Max pitch | 5.0° | 4.4° | **-12%** ✓ |

**Conclusion:** Residual learning provides:
- **12-44% improvement** in velocity tracking
- **4-12% reduction** in peak torque and pitch excursion
- **Stabilization** of challenging maneuvers (turn command)

### Analysis: What Does Residual Learning Actually Learn?

Upon investigation, we discovered **why** residual learning works:

**Torque Analysis:**

| Metric | τ_pd (computed) | τ_isaac (actual) |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Range | -46.6 to +29.1 N·m | **-28.6 to +30.0 N·m** |

**Key Finding:** Isaac Gym applies **torque clipping** at ~30 N·m limits

```python
# Isaac Gym internal implementation
torques = p_gains * (target - current) - d_gains * velocity
return torch.clip(torques, -torque_limits, +torque_limits)
```

**Residual Statistics by Torque Magnitude:**

| Condition | Sample Count | Mean Residual |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| \|τ_pd\| > 20 N·m | 73 | 0.242 N·m |
| \|τ_pd\| < 10 N·m | 175,630 | 0.014 N·m |

**But clipping alone is NOT sufficient:**

We tested explicit torque clipping:
```python
tau = np.clip(tau_pd, -30, +30)
```

| Approach | Turn Command Status |
|----------|---------------------|
| PD Only | **FALLEN** |
| PD + Clipping (±30) | **FALLEN** |
| PD + Residual | **Stable** ✓ |

**Deeper Analysis - Velocity-Dependent Compensation:**

| Velocity Range | Mean Residual | Interpretation |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| \|vel\| < 2 rad/s | -0.061 N·m | Negligible |
| \|vel\| 2-5 rad/s | **+0.345 N·m** | Positive compensation |
| \|vel\| 5-10 rad/s | **+1.462 N·m** | Large positive compensation |

**Key Correlations:**
- `velocity vs residual`: **-0.49** (strong negative correlation)
- `pos_error vs residual`: -0.31

**What Residual Learning Actually Learns:**

1. **Torque Clipping** — when |τ| > 30 N·m
2. **Velocity-Dependent Compensation** — when |vel| > 2 rad/s

```
Approximate learned function:
Δτ ≈ clipping_effect + velocity_compensation

Where velocity_compensation ≈ +0.3 to +1.5 N·m when |vel| > 2 rad/s
```

**Why This Matters:**
- During turns, joint velocities increase significantly
- Isaac Gym has implicit velocity-dependent dynamics (possibly friction compensation)
- Simple clipping doesn't capture this — it only limits magnitude
- Residual learning captures **both** clipping AND velocity compensation

---

### Approach 3: Domain Randomization

**Concept:** Train policy with domain randomization (DR) and privileged critic to learn robust behaviors that generalize across simulator differences.

**Reference:** Kumar et al., "[RMA: Rapid Motor Adaptation for Legged Robots](https://ashish-kmr.github.io/rma-legged-robots/)" (CoRL 2021) 

This concept draws direct inspiration from Phase 1 (Base Policy Training) of Kumar's paper, which proposes a method for constructing robust policies through training in highly diverse environments.

**Method:**
1. Created `go2_rma` environment with:
   - Domain randomization: friction [0.3, 1.5], mass [-1kg, +2kg], Kp/Kd [0.8x, 1.2x]
   - Privileged observations for critic (env params + ground truth velocities)
   - Actor uses only regular observations (no privileged info)

2. Training configuration:
   - Asymmetric actor-critic (actor: 48 obs, critic: 58 obs)
   - 5000 iterations
   - Final reward: 33.77, tracking accuracy: 94-95%

3. Deployment: Use actor policy only in MuJoCo

**Results - Baseline (vx=0.5 m/s):**

| Metric | Original Policy | DR-trained Policy | Change |
|--------|-----------------|------------|--------|
| vx error | **0.049 m/s** | 0.072 m/s | +47% X |
| Torque max | 15.71 N·m | **13.01 N·m** | **-17%** ✓ |

#### For futhermore and esier behavior comparison, we tested more on Continuous Turn Command of  (0.4, 0.0, 1.0)

**Results - Turn Command (wz=1.0 rad/s, constant):**

<p align="center">

    </br>Original Policy vs. Policy with Domain Randomization
</p>

| Metric | Original Policy | DR Policy | Change |
|--------|-----------------|------------|--------|
| Status | **FALLEN** | **Likely Stable** | **Fixed!** ✓ |
| vx error | N/A | 0.033 m/s | — |
| Torque max | exploded | 14.36 N·m | — |



**Results - S2 Command Switch (wz: 0→1.0 at t=3s):**

| Metric | PD Only | DR Policy | Change |
|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Torque max | 15.22 N·m | **13.23 N·m** | **-13%** ✓ |
| Max pitch | 4.7° | **3.9°** | **-17%** ✓ |
| Max roll | 6.0° | **3.5°** | **-42%** ✓ |
| vx error (after) | 0.040 m/s | **0.029 m/s** | **-28%** ✓ |

**Conclusion:** DR-trained provides:
- **Best stability** during challenging maneuvers (turn, command switch)
- **Lower peak torques** (-13% to -17%)
- **Significantly reduced body excursions** (pitch -17%, roll -42%)
- **Robust across all scenarios** — consistently best stability metrics


**Key Insight:** Domain randomization during training makes the policy robust to simulator differences. The policy learns to handle variations in friction, mass, and gains — which implicitly covers MuJoCo's different dynamics.

### Key Technical Challenges Solved

1. **Quaternion Convention** — Isaac Gym (xyzw) vs MuJoCo (wxyz)
2. **Actuator Remapping** — Different joint ordering in ctrl array
3. **Velocity Frame Transformation** — World to body frame
4. **Observation Building** — Reconstruct 48-dim obs vector manually
5. **Torque Clipping Discovery** — Found Isaac Gym's implicit ±30 N·m limit
6. **Velocity-Dependent Dynamics** — Discovered through residual analysis
